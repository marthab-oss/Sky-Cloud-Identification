  - **[Link](https://github.com/yuhao-nie/Cloud-dection-in-sky-images)**
  - **Objective**: identify cloud pixels in sky images for classification for solar forecasting
  - **Methods**: algorithm from  Nie et al. (2020) study, with integration of NRBR (normalized red blue ratio) and CSL (clear sky library)
  - **Outcomes**: identification of several possible improvements: algorithm not self-adaptive when different camera is used, deep learning would be better option
  - **Relation to the Project**: distinguish betwen clear sky and clouds
